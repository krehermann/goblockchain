Episode 12: add transactions to block

for now add all transactions from mempool into block. later need to limit
the number based on some size or complexity

plumb logger to blockchain. using functional opts very nice, with slight startup overhead

Episode 11: creating blocks

problem in server.Start:
1. the ticker is only needed is the server is a validatore
2. the rpc receiver can block the the ticker. this is very bad b/c it means that
    the blocktime is not reliable

choosen solution:
refactor the start code to be composed of two go routines, one to handle incoming rpc and
one to handle validator

Implement createBlock in server
Add DataHash to blocks -- done in Sign, which is different and seemingly (much) easier than the validatore
