Episode 11: creating blocks

problem in server.Start:
1. the ticker is only needed is the server is a validatore
2. the rpc receiver can block the the ticker. this is very bad b/c it means that
    the blocktime is not reliable

choosen solution:
refactor the start code to be composed of two go routines, one to handle incoming rpc and
one to handle validator

Implement createBlock in server
Add DataHash to blocks -- done in Sign, which is different and seemingly (much) easier than the validatore
